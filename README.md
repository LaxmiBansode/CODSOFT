# CODSOFT Java Development Internship

Welcome to the repository showcasing the projects completed during my internship at CODSOFT. This internship focused on enhancing technical skills in Java development through a series of diverse tasks. Below is a brief overview of each task and the associated projects.

# Internship Tasks Overview
Task 1: Number Game üéÆ
Description: Developed a Number Guessing Game where a random number between 1 and 100 is generated. Users guess the number, receiving feedback on whether their guess is correct, too high, or too low. The game includes limits on attempts and options for multiple rounds, with a scoring system based on performance.
Skills Enhanced: Random number generation, user input handling, game logic, score tracking.

Task 2: Student Grade Calculator üìö
Description: Created a system to input marks for each subject, calculate total marks, average percentage, and assign grades based on the percentage. This task involved handling and processing data to provide meaningful grading feedback.
Skills Enhanced: Data processing, arithmetic calculations, grading logic.

Task 3: ATM Interface üèß
Description: Designed and implemented a class to simulate an ATM machine, including features for withdrawing, depositing, and checking balances. Integrated secure transaction management and user-friendly messages to enhance the overall user experience.
Skills Enhanced: Secure transaction handling, user interface design, input validation, object-oriented programming.

Task 4: Quiz Application üìù
Description: Built a quiz application featuring:
Storage of quiz questions, multiple-choice options, and correct answers.
A timer for each question to enforce time limits.
Display of one question at a time with options for users to select and submit answers.
Score calculation based on correct answers and a result screen summarizing performance.
Skills Enhanced: Timed interactions, multiple-choice logic, score calculation, user interface design.

Task 5: Student Registration System üéâ
Description: Developed a Student Management System to manage student records with functionalities to:
Add, remove, and search for students using roll numbers.
Persist data in a students.txt file, ensuring data integrity.
Provide a console-based user interface for managing student information.
Skills Enhanced: File handling, list management, CRUD operations, user interaction.

Each task provided practical experience in various aspects of Java programming, including game development, data management, and user interface design. The projects collectively demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of core Java concepts and application development.
